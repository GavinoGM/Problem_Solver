# SmartSolver - AI-Powered Problem Solving Application


## üìã Description

SmartSolver is a web application that uses AI to help users analyze problems, reframe them from different perspectives, and generate innovative solutions. The app guides users through a structured problem-solving process enhanced by artificial intelligence.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Problem Analysis**: Detailed problem breakdown with stakeholders, root causes, and impact assessment
- **AI-Powered Reframing**: Alternative perspectives on your problem
- **Solution Generation**: AI-generated solutions based on context and problem reframing
- **Solution Enhancement**: Elaboration, examples, action plans, and metrics for each solution
- **Multi-Model Support**: Integration with OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and Anthropic (Claude) models
- **Export Functionality**: Save solutions as structured text files

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **AI**: OpenAI and Anthropic API integration
- **Hosting**: Replit

## üì¶ Installation

### Using Replit (Easiest Option)

# Start the server
npm start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Setting up API Keys

#### On Replit
1. In your Replit project, go to "Tools" > "Secrets"
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key (optional)
   - `OPENAI_MODEL`: (Optional) To specify a different model than the default (gpt-4)

#### Local Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4 # optional
```

## üß† How to Use

1. **Define the Problem**:
   - Describe your problem in detail
   - Select the domain (general, product, technology, marketing, etc.)
   - Set the complexity level
   - Add additional context (optional)

2. **Analyze the Problem**:
   - Click "Analyze Problem"
   - Add stakeholders, root causes, and impact assessment (optional)

3. **Explore Alternative Perspectives**:
   - Click "Reframe" to get alternative problem perspectives
   - Add custom reframings (optional)

4. **Generate Solutions**:
   - Click the light bulb icon next to a reframing to generate solutions
   - The system will generate solutions based on the reframed problem

5. **Enhance Solutions**:
   - Click on a solution to view details
   - Use "Elaborate," "Examples," "Action Plan," and "Metrics" buttons
   - Ask custom questions to the AI

6. **Export Solutions**:
   - Use the "Export" button to save individual solutions as text files
   - Or "Save Solutions" to save all generated solutions

## üîÑ Supported AI Models

### OpenAI
- GPT-4 (Most Capable)
- GPT-4 Turbo
- GPT-3.5 Turbo (Faster)
- GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K

### Anthropic
- Claude 3 Opus (Most Capable)
- Claude 3 Sonnet (Balanced)
- Claude 3 Haiku (Fast)

## üè† Deployment Options

### Replit (Recommended)
The app is designed to run seamlessly on Replit:
1. Fork the project to your Replit account
2. Configure API keys in Secrets
3. Run the app
4. The app will be available at your Replit URL

### Other Hosting Options
If you want to deploy elsewhere:

1. **Vercel/Netlify/Render**:
   - Set up environment variables for API keys
   - Configure to run `npm start` as the start command

2. **Traditional VPS**:
   - Clone the repository
   - Install Node.js
   - Run with PM2 or similar: `pm2 start server.js`

### Resource Requirements
- Minimal server requirements: 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core
- Storage: ~50MB for code and dependencies
- The main resource consumption comes from API calls to OpenAI/Anthropic

## üîê API Key Security

- API keys are never sent to the frontend
- All requests pass through the server
- On Replit, keys are stored as "Secrets" and are not publicly accessible
- In local configuration, use `.env` files (added to `.gitignore`)
