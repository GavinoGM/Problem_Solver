App Complexity Level Explained

api key configuration troubleshooting help needed

what is the role of the complexity level in the app?

GG

6 hours ago
Based on the code, the complexity level (1-5) serves several purposes in the SmartSolver app:

User Input: It's captured through a range slider in the UI that lets users indicate how complex their problem is on a scale of 1-5.

API Context: The complexity level is passed to the OpenAI API through the _buildSolutionPrompt method in api-service.js to help generate more appropriate solutions. A higher complexity level signals to the AI to generate more sophisticated or detailed solutions.

Solution Implementation: The complexity affects the displayed implementation estimates in the solution details modal:

Lower complexity (1): 1-2 weeks implementation time, 60-70% success rate
Medium complexity (3): 2-4 weeks implementation time, 70-80% success rate
Higher complexity (5): 4-8 weeks implementation time, 80-90% success rate
The complexity level helps tailor both the AI-generated solutions and the implementation guidance to match the problem's difficulty level.

I would like to give to the users the possibility to manually Modify Ai-Powered Reframing for a more personalised experience

I'll help you add manual reframing capability to the AI-powered problem reframing section. This will involve modifying the HTML and adding functionality to let users edit and add their own reframing statements.

First, let's update the reframing section in index.html:

index.html
Now let's add the JavaScript functionality by updating the reframeProblem function:

These changes will:

Add a button to create custom reframes
Provide a textarea for entering custom reframing statements
Allow editing of custom reframes
Integrate custom reframes with AI-generated ones
Maintain the existing AI reframing functionality
Users can now click the "Add Custom Reframe" button to add their own problem reframing statements alongside the AI-generated ones. They can also edit their custom reframes using the pencil icon.

Looking at the error logs and the code, I can see the issue. The problem is that the model names for Claude-3 models in the request don't match Anthropic's API requirements. The date suffix '-20240229' should not be included in the API request, but we're currently not handling this correctly for Sonnet and Haiku.

it's not working. please consider also these suggestions that come from Antrhopic Versions
When making API requests, you must send an anthropic-version request header. For example, anthropic-version: 2023-06-01. If you are using our client libraries, this is handled for you automatically.

For any given API version, we will preserve:

Existing input parameters
Existing output parameters
However, we may do the following:

Add additional optional inputs
Add additional values to the output
Change conditions for specific error types
Add new variants to enum-like output values (for example, streaming event types)
Generally, if you are using the API as documented in this reference, we will not break your usage.

​
Version history
We always recommend using the latest API version whenever possible. Previous versions are considered deprecated and may be unavailable for new users.

2023-06-01
New format for streaming server-sent events (SSE):
Completions are incremental. For example, " Hello", " my", " name", " is", " Claude." instead of " Hello", " Hello my", " Hello my name", " Hello my name is", " Hello my name is Claude.".
All events are named events, rather than data-only events.
Removed unnecessary data: [DONE] event.
Removed legacy exception and truncated values in responses.

GG

gavinogiovannim
Assistant
1 hour ago
Let me analyze the differences between OpenAI and Anthropic implementations in the codebase:

Request Format Differences
Looking at server.js, there are significant differences in how requests are formatted:
For Anthropic:

{
  model: finalModelName,
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: formattedMessages[formattedMessages.length - 1].content
  }],
  system: "You are an expert problem-solving assistant...",
  max_tokens: 4000,
  stream: false
}
For OpenAI:

{
  model: req.body.model,
  messages: formattedMessages,
  temperature: 0.9,
  presence_penalty: 0.6,
  frequency_penalty: 0.6,
  max_tokens: req.body.max_tokens || 4000
}
Context Handling
There's a potential issue in the Anthropic implementation - it's only sending the last message content while OpenAI receives all messages including the system prompt and context. This means Anthropic might not be getting the full context for reframing and solutions.

Structured Context
In api-service.js, the structured context building is the same for both:

let structuredContext = contextText;
if (stakeholdersText) {
    structuredContext += `\n\nStakeholders: ${stakeholdersText}`;
}
if (rootCauses) {
    structuredContext += `\n\nPotential Root Causes: ${rootCausesText}`;
}
if (impactText) {
    structuredContext += `\n\nImpact Assessment: ${impactText}`;
}
However, due to the message formatting difference, Anthropic might not receive this full context.

Let's fix this to ensure both providers receive the same context:

server.js
This change ensures that:

All context is preserved in Anthropic requests
System messages are properly translated to Anthropic's format
Both providers receive the same level of context for generating solutions and reframing
The error logs from the webview suggest there were issues with API calls failing and response parsing, which might have been related to this context handling difference. This fix should help provide more consistent results between both providers.

After analyzing the code, I can see there's an issue with how context is being handled for Anthropic requests. Looking at server.js, while the context is being processed and logged:

console.log('Processing request with full context:', {
  model: req.body.model,
  provider: 'anthropic',
  hasStakeholders: req.body.messages[1].content.includes('Stakeholders:'),
  hasRootCauses: req.body.messages[1].content.includes('Root Causes:'),
  hasImpact: req.body.messages[1].content.includes('Impact Assessment:')
});
The Anthropic request is not properly formatting all messages and context. Let's fix this in server.js:

server.js
This change ensures that:

All context from formattedMessages is preserved and sent to Anthropic
The system prompt explicitly instructs the model to consider additional context

could you better explain to me what's happening when user chose several levels of Complexity?

GG

gavinogiovannim
Assistant
48 minutes ago
Looking at the codebase, I can explain how the complexity levels work in SmartSolver:

The complexity level is controlled by a range slider in index.html that goes from 1 to 5. This complexity information flows through several parts of the application:

In the UI (index.html):
Users can select complexity from 1-5 using a slider
The current value is displayed as "{value}/5"
This is tracked in the currentComplexity variable
In API calls (api-service.js):
The complexity level is passed to the AI model as part of the prompt
It's used in the _buildSolutionPrompt function:
_buildSolutionPrompt(problem, domain, complexity, context) {
    return `...
    Complexity: ${complexity}/5
    ...`;
}
Impact on Solutions:
Higher complexity (4-5):

More detailed solutions
Longer implementation timeframes (4-8 weeks)
Higher success rates (80-90%)
Medium complexity (3):

Balanced solutions
Moderate timeframes (2-4 weeks)
Average success rates (70-80%)
Lower complexity (1-2):

Simpler, quicker solutions
Shorter timeframes (1-2 weeks)
Lower success rates (60-70%)
This complexity level helps the AI model tailor its responses to match the appropriate depth and sophistication level requested by the user.

and choosing in Problem Domain different implementations how affect the results of the app?

GG

gavinogiovannim
Assistant
47 minutes ago
Looking at the codebase, the Problem Domain selection in the application affects the results in several important ways:

Prompt Construction: In api-service.js, the domain selection influences how the AI prompt is constructed. The domain is included in the prompt template:
Domain: ${domain}
Response Customization: Based on the domain selection (general, product, tech, marketing, business, team, personal), the system adjusts:
The icon shown (different Font Awesome icons for each domain)
The context framing of solutions
The type of metrics and KPIs suggested
Domain-Specific UI Elements: In index.html, each domain has specific styling and icons:
const domains = {
    general: 'General Problem',
    product: 'Product/Service Challenge',
    tech: 'Technical Challenge',
    marketing: 'Marketing Challenge',
    business: 'Business Strategy',
    team: 'Team/Organization Challenge',
    personal: 'Personal Challenge'
};
Solution Generation: When generating solutions in server.js, the domain affects:
The context provided to the AI model
The type of structured solutions returned
The complexity recommendations
The implementation timeframes suggested (e.g., technical solutions might have longer timeframes)
For example, if you select:

Technical Domain: Solutions focus more on implementation details, system architecture, and technical metrics
Marketing Domain: Solutions emphasize customer engagement, market reach, and ROI metrics
Business Domain: Solutions concentrate on strategic initiatives, cost-benefit analysis, and business impact
Team Domain: Solutions focus on people management, collaboration, and organizational dynamics
The domain selection helps the AI model provide more targeted and relevant solutions for your specific context.

do you think that we could add to the user better or more control of the temperature? We could start to implement this functionality for OPen AI OpenAI API Temperature Parameter
Purpose: Similar to Anthropic, OpenAI's temperature setting determines how random or deterministic the model's output will be. Lower values prioritize high-probability tokens, leading to predictable results, while higher values encourage diversity and creativity.

Range: The temperature can be set between 0.0 and 2.0, with a default value of either 1.0 or 0.7, depending on the specific model or interface used.

Usage:

At very low temperatures (e.g., 0), the model produces deterministic outputs by consistently selecting the highest-probability tokens.

High temperatures (e.g., above 1.5) lead to more varied and creative outputs but may introduce nonsensical or incoherent results.

before implementing i think it would be better to take in consideration that Open AI and Antrhopic allow different values for the temperature. Maybe it coudl be better to have a sort of percentage slider parametered to the two models. I copy here the temperatures values for the two models. Feature Anthropic API OpenAI API

In api-service.js, the temperature is being correctly obtained from the UI slider:
temperature: parseFloat(document.getElementById('temperatureRange').value) / 100
In server.js, for OpenAI, the temperature is properly passed:
temperature: req.body.temperature || 0.7
However, I notice an issue in server.js where for Anthropic API calls, while the temperature is received, it's not being properly normalized for Anthropic's range (0-1). Let's fix this:

server.js
Now both APIs will handle temperature correctly:

OpenAI: Range 0-2.0 (passed directly)
Anthropic: Range 0-1.0 (capped at 1.0)
The UI slider is already properly scaled based on the selected model through the updateTemperatureRange() function in index.html, which adjusts the max value based on whether an Anthropic or OpenAI model is selected.

These changes will add an export button next to each reframed problem that allows users to save individual reframes as text files. The exported file will include both the original problem and the reframed perspective.

Nothing to commit

To add a button for exporting text beside each AI-powered problem reframing, we will modify the HTML structure where the reframed problems are displayed in your index.html. This involves adding an export button next to each reframe.

Here’s how to implement this:

Update your index.html to include the export button next to each reframe.

JavaScript code for handling the export functionality.

Updated HTML Structure
Locate the section in your index.html where you're displaying the AI-generated reframes, and modify it to include the export button as follows:

<div class="flex justify-between items-start">
    <p>${reframe}</p>
    <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
        <button class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 generate-solutions-btn" title="Generate solutions for this reframe">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
        </button>
        <button class="export-btn text-green-600 hover:text-green-800" title="Export this reframe">
            Export
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
JavaScript Functionality
After adding the buttons, you need to handle the export functionality in your JavaScript. This can be done in your api-service.js or a relevant script block. Here’s a sample function to export the text:

document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (event.target.classList.contains('export-btn')) {
        const reframeText = event.target.closest('.flex').querySelector('p').textContent;
        const blob = new Blob([reframeText], { type: 'text/plain' });
        const link = document.createElement('a');
        link.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        link.download = 'reframed_problem.txt';
        document.body.appendChild(link);
        link.click();
        document.body.removeChild(link);
    }
});
Full Integration
With these updates, users will see an "Export" button next to each AI-powered reframing. When they click the button, it will trigger the export functionality and prompt them to download a text file with the reframed problem text.

Make sure to copy this code into your respective files, refresh the page, and test the new export feature!
